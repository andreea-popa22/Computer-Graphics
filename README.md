## Labs homework:

1. Tasks:

   - (2p) Use available primitives to make a sketch of a house, along with trees / other items.

   - (1p) Choose four points A, B, C, D. Explore various SVG primitives (line, polyline, path - with various options). Use both absolute positioning and relative positioning.

   - (1p) Let the curve c (t) = (200t + 300cos (t), 300t-400sin (t)). Choose four values of t, draw the corresponding points using circles and construct various other primitives related to these points (using line, path, with different colors).

2. Tasks:

   - (3p) Create an SVG file with a 2D "meaningful" scene in which you use at least 10 distinct elements.

   - (3p) Represent a known curve in SVG. 

     For both requirements, prepare a short documentation.
