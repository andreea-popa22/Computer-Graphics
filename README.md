## Labs homework:

1. Tasks:

   - Use available primitives to make a sketch of a house, along with trees / other items.

   - Choose four points A, B, C, D. Explore various SVG primitives (line, polyline, path - with various options). Use both absolute positioning and relative positioning.

   - Let the curve c (t) = (200t + 300cos (t), 300t-400sin (t)). Choose four values of t, draw the corresponding points using circles and construct various other primitives related to these points (using line, path, with different colors).

2. Tasks:

   - Create an SVG file with a 2D "meaningful" scene in which you use at least 10 distinct elements.

   - Represent a known curve in SVG. 

     For both requirements, prepare a short documentation.

   Scene:

   ![Scene](https://github.com/andreea-popa22/Computer-Graphics/blob/master/lab-homework/tema2/scene2.png?raw=true)

3. Tasks:

   - (team) Make a figure to represent an object / an animal / etc. in which the connection of some Bezier curves should appear explicitly. Each member has to perform a calculation based on the course model. Documentation includes (i) a sketch; (ii) the calculations made by each member.

4. Tasks:

   - Explore working with GIMP. Apply four different filters to an image and send screenshots with the result.
   - Choose four other effects that can be achieved in GIMP and apply them to an image. Submit the results.

5. Tasks:

   - Use basic GIMP functionality to process an image, following the implementation of an idea / concept. You can use any other image editing software.

6. Tasks:

   - Implement a procedure explained in the course / lab (blur, edge enhance, edge detect, emboss or sharpen.
   - Use the Fourier plugin, explaining in a short documentation the effect obtained.

7. Tasks:

   - Use the basic features of Blender to create a model as complex as possible.

8. Tasks:

   - Continue modeling one of the examples presented in the lab.

9. Tasks:

   - Explain and write a program / script that generates a given object in a parametric form. Integrate in the complex 3D project made in theme 7 the object thus generated.
