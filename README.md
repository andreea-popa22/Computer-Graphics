## Labs homework:

1. Tasks:

   - (2p) Use available primitives to make a sketch of a house, along with trees / other items.

   - (1p) Choose four points A, B, C, D. Explore various SVG primitives (line, polyline, path - with various options). Use both absolute positioning and relative positioning.

   - (1p) Let the curve c (t) = (200t + 300cos (t), 300t-400sin (t)). Choose four values of t, draw the corresponding points using circles and construct various other primitives related to these points (using line, path, with different colors).

2. Tasks:

   - (3p) Create an SVG file with a 2D "meaningful" scene in which you use at least 10 distinct elements.

   - (3p) Represent a known curve in SVG. 

     For both requirements, prepare a short documentation.

   Scene 1:

3. Tasks:
   
   - (4p) (team) Make a figure to represent an object / an animal / etc. in which the connection of some Bezier curves should appear explicitly. Each member has to perform a calculation based on the course model. Documentation includes (i) a sketch; (ii) the calculations made by each member.
